There are many hardware devices that can be used as a tool for commission of cybercrime. These devices are listed below:
•	Access control devices
•	Answering machines and voice mail systems (digital and analog)
•	Caller ID devices
•	Cell phones
•	Computers
•	Credit card fraud devices
•	Customer or user cards and devices
•	Data preservation (duplicating, imaging, copying)
•	Digital cameras ( webcam and security cameras)
•	Encryption tools and passphrase protection
•	Facsimile (fax)
•	Global positioning system
•	Home entertainment
•	Keystroke monitoring
•	Personal digital assistants
•	Sniffers
•	Personal digital assistants etc.

In this project we have discussed and provided a general description of a few technology-related hardware tools that may be encountered during an investigation or that may be useful in identifying and investigating electronic evidence. We have provided a brief overview of the function and usefulness of these tools. The readers of this report will learn how common objects and devices can store relevant information. Further we have tried to explain how these devices help in commission of crime, so the reader is encouraged to think out of the box and consider all possible investigative uses of the device.
