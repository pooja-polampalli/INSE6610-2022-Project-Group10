<h1>Mobile Investigation Tools </h1>
Today, the usage of smartphones have become more efficient and popular due to the reduced cost of manufacturing and developing hardware technologies (sensors / processors, etc.) and software systems (Android, IOS, etc.).  For mobile forensic investigators, the chief evidence of interest can be subscriber identification module (SIM), mobile memory, external memory card and Network Service Providers (NSP) [1]. Mobile phones are now used as a digital tool for committing various crimes. In particular, it can be used as a means of communication to support traditional crimes [2]. In all cases, the phone contains evidence. For example, a typical smartphone contains evidence data, including user-generated information such as contacts, audio, video, and files. Internet-related information such as email messages and web browser history; and installed third-party applications [3].

<h2>Techniques for Android Forensic:</h2>

<ol>
<li><h3>Manual Acquisition:</h3> In this technique, a forensic investigator or analyst uses the mobile device's user interface  to examine available content. When browsing the device, the inspector will take pictures of each screen containing the necessary data. The advantage of this technique is that no tools are required to collect the data. At the same time, the drawback of this technique is that it can only restore user-visible data  on  devices  which is time consuming [3].</li>

<li><h3>Physical Acquisition:</h3> This technique involves cloning  the data available on the phone device. This process duplicates deleted data and unallocated space. After replication, the replicated data is analysed using a variety of tools [3].</li>

<li><h4>Logical Acquisition:</h4> This technique requires less manual intervention or cloning. It collects data/information available on your phone (generally) using automated tools to sync your phone and PC. Most free tools available  perform logical investigations [3].</li>
