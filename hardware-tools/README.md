This report is for all readers aiming to develop a career in information security (investigators, first responders, detectives, prosecutors, etc.) 
who may have limited or no experience with technology-related crimes, or to investigate them. It is intended to serve as a resource for using available
tools and techniques. Rather, we'll cover the most common techniques, devices, and tools.

Technology is advancing rapidly and the information in this special report should be viewed in the light of current technology and  adjusted as necessary.
When dealing with technology, the following general forensic and procedural principles apply: 
■  The steps taken to secure and collect evidence should not alter that evidence.  
■  Activities related to the seizure, inspection, storage, or transmission of electronic evidence must be fully documented, retained, and made available for review.  
■  Special training may be required to test many  devices

The main purpose of report is  to provide a general description of  technology-related tools and devices that  may be encountered during an investigation
or that can aid in the identification and investigation of electronic evidence. We have given an overview of their features and utilities is provided,
and other special research considerations are discussed. This chapter describes how people can use these devices to facilitate and commit a crime.
Readers are encouraged to think creatively about the device and consider all possible purposes of investigation and the forms the device can take. As devices
may  be multifunctional, investigators should ensure that all relevant devices and storage media are collected. 

For example,  some watches have data storage capabilities and some mobile phones can perform camera functions. As more and more functions are condensed into a single device,
investigators must be aware that relevant information may be stored on seemingly mundane or mundane objects or devices.  Devices can also be modified to perform
functions beyond what the manufacturer intended. 

For example, the Microsoft Xbox ® was designed to play video games, but it can be modified to store data or turned into a fully functional computer. Devices may
also be physically modified to perform functions far different from their original purpose. For example, mobile phones, pagers and pens have turned into guns. 

Investigators need to be aware of the device's surroundings to provide clues about the device's potential for alteration.
