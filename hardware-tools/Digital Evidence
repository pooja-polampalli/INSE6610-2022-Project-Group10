Any material that is stored on digital devices that is admissible in court is considered digital evidence. Typical instances include data kept on a computer or mobile device, including emails, pictures, and internet browser histories.
Other instances include a vehicle's navigation history, logs from an electronic door lock, swipes and scans on a transit card, and temperature settings on a smart thermometer. Digital evidence frequently outweighs other sorts of evidence in volume, expressiveness, and accessibility due to the pervasiveness of digital devices used in crimes.

Due to the prevalence of digital devices in our daily lives, digital evidence is frequently linked to cybercrimes including cyberattacks, child pornography, and credit card fraud, but it can also be found in many other crimes. Since digital evidence can be altered or replicated, its authenticity is frequently contested, although American courts typically dismiss this claim in the absence of evidence of tampering. When managing digital evidence, law enforcement agencies should follow the correct chain of custody procedures and make sure that all evidence is kept intact to allow for accurate forensic analysis.
When handling digital evidence, the authorities should also take the appropriate safety procedures. Evidence from a different crime may be found when detectives extract evidence from a digital device.
The evidence cannot be used in court without a second warrant, which must be obtained by the investigators. Criminals frequently leave digital traces on their digital gadgets in general.
