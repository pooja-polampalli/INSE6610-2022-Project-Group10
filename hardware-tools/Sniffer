Depending on the amount of detail obtained, a "sniffer" is a device or piece of software that extracts communication data straight from a network and can function as a wiretap equivalent on a computer network. Network packet information, which identifies the source and destination of communications, is one of the data sets gathered. A sniffer can also record the entirety of a communication.
In an effort to safeguard and keep an eye on their computer networks, communication service providers (such as universities, governments, and ISPs) and corporate information technology (IT) departments frequently use sniffers. Monitoring the data a sniffer collects can notify security experts of an unauthorised network intrusion or employee abuse of network resources.

Value of Sniffers

To Investigators:
An investigator may be able to determine a communication's source IP address from data obtained by a network sniffer.
The following can be completely recorded with full content capture:
•	Transferred data (including the data itself).
•	Communications that are evidence-based or incriminating (electronic mail, etc.).
•	The existence of accomplices and their potential identification.
•	The subject's method of operation.

To subjects:
In order to obtain information, subjects install sniffers. The following tasks are frequently carried out with sniffers:

•	Users are named.
•	assemble passwords.
•	Discover the network's computers.
•	data theft
•	Observe communication (illegal wiretap).


Identifying and obtaining sniffers
•	A sniffer might be challenging to find because it lacks any distinctive physical characteristics.

•	a dedicated computer with specialised software that is linked to a network at a data "bottleneck" can serve as a sniffer. You can keep an eye on every incoming and outgoing traffic. A sniffer may be incorporated into an intrusion detection system when employed internally by a company or agency to monitor its own network (IDS). Commercial IDS packages are offered by security software providers online.

•	Sniffer software can be a discrete application installed on a single desktop computer that gathers all network traffic that is visible to it. These programmes are widely used by hackers and are simple to conceal. They can be found online.


Special investigatory and other considerations
•	Companies and government organisations frequently keep IDS logs or archives. These can be acquired for research needs.
•	Sniffers can produce enormous volumes of data, depending on a network's size and activity (number of computers, amount of traffic). When requesting IDS logs, investigators need to be mindful of the possible amount of data. Such demands ought to be as detailed as feasible.
•	If the subject uses encrypted communications, the data that the sniffer collects will also be encrypted (but not the header data).
•	Ask for copies of the banners and user agreements (see Legal Considerations section below for more information).


Scenario
1.	An investigator is requested to visit a local business where multiple computer systems have been infiltrated by an outsider. One of the impacted systems has sniffer log files that the hacker has been maintaining and periodically accessing, according to analysis. The hacker has been compiling internal network traffic. The sniffer logs include the network names, user names, and passwords of other machines within the organisation. With the aid of this data, the investigator can locate further compromised user accounts and victim PCs at the business for additional investigation and proof.
2.	An employee may have transferred private information from his work computer to his personal Internet account, according to a state agency. The investigators choose to place a sniffer at the organization's "firewall" because that specific person has access to numerous computer systems. Investigators are provided with the time, date, originating and destination IP addresses, as well as the substance of the employee's transfer, including the suspect data, by the network traffic sniffer. Investigators can identify the culprit as being at the keyboard of the computer that originated the illicit transfer by using witnesses and security cameras.
