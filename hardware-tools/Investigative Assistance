Technology's nature makes it common for criminal activity to cross jurisdictional boundaries, especially in cases of crimes committed online. To successfully investigate these kinds of crimes and catch the culprits, it is crucial for law enforcement personnel to work with other authorities at the Federal, State, and local levels.
Officers employing technology in investigations should also be aware of the technical and investigative support that can be obtained from federal, state, local, and professional organizations. 
The officer must first determine the specifics of the offence and whether a prosecution is warranted under local laws, as with any inquiry. Can the charges be upheld, for instance, even if guilt is established? Given the numerous new technologies in use, common law, as well as federal and state statutes, frequently have not kept up with the crimes. The global reach of the Internet is another aspect to take into account while looking at cybercrimes. It is frequently helpful to speak with your prosecutor to learn more about particular offences.



Internet Crimes Against Children Regional Task Forces:
The Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force Program aids local and state law enforcement in creating a strategy for handling child pornography and cyber enticement cases. This aid includes forensic and investigative elements, technical support, victim care, and community outreach. Task forces have been organised all around the country.
In response to the rise in children and teenagers utilising the Internet, the spread of child pornography, and the increased online activity of predators looking for unsupervised interaction with minor victims, the ICAC Program was created.
